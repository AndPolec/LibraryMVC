## General info
The application is designed to optimize the operation of small to medium-sized online libraries. The application allows users to browse the library catalog and manage the entire loan process, from the moment of physically collecting the book at the library to the moment of return. Users can also view their borrowing history and any associated overdue fees.

For library staff, the application offers tools for managing the book catalog. Additionally, librarians log all loan and return transactions in the system and have access to information about exceeded loan terms and accrued penalty fees for delays. This introduces transparency and control over the fine-imposing process, consequently improving the library's operation.

The application is built in Clean Architecture and Service-Repository pattern.
